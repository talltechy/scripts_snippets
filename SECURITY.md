touch sensitive_file.conf
chmod 600 sensitive_file.conf

# Example: Input validation
if [[ ! "$user_input" =~ ^[a-zA-Z0-9_-]+$ ]]; then
    echo "Invalid input format" >&2
    exit 1
fi

# Example: Secure logging
log_security_event() {
    echo "$(date -Iseconds): SECURITY: $*" >> /var/log/security.log
    chmod 600 /var/log/security.log
}
```
