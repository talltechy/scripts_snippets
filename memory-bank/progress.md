# Progress: Scripts & Snippets Repository

## What Works
- Core memory bank files (projectbrief.md, productContext.md, activeContext.md, systemPatterns.md, techContext.md, progress.md) are present and structured
- Documentation templates established for ongoing project tracking
- Repository structure supports Bash, PowerShell, Python, Excel/VBA, Batch, Registry, and vulnerability fix scripts

## What's Left to Build
- Populate documentation with detailed status of each script and module
- Add summaries of stable scripts and highlight flagship tools
- Document known issues and technical debt for each script category

## Current Status
- Documentation and memory bank initialization complete
- Project is in active documentation and maintenance mode

## Known Issues
- Some script categories may lack up-to-date documentation or usage examples
- Need to establish a routine for regular memory bank updates

## Evolution of Project Decisions
- Adopted a hierarchical memory bank structure for project continuity
- Emphasized security-first and cross-platform scripting as guiding principles
- Shifted focus to documentation-driven development for maintainability
