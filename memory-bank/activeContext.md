# Active Context: Scripts & Snippets Repository

## Current Work Focus
- Memory bank initialization and documentation structure setup
- Ensuring all core context files exist and are ready for ongoing updates

## Recent Changes
- Created productContext.md, activeContext.md, and progress.md with initial templates
- Reviewed and confirmed the presence of projectbrief.md, systemPatterns.md, and techContext.md
- Verified alignment of documentation with repository goals and architecture

## Next Steps
- Populate progress.md with current project status and known issues
- Begin documenting recent script changes and new additions in activeContext.md
- Establish a routine for updating memory bank files after significant project changes

## Active Decisions & Considerations
- Maintain strict separation between project scope, technical patterns, and active work documentation
- Use templates as living documents, updating them as work progresses

## Important Patterns & Preferences
- Hierarchical documentation structure as defined in .clinerules/
- Emphasis on security-first scripting and cross-platform compatibility

## Learnings & Project Insights
- A well-maintained memory bank accelerates onboarding and project continuity
- Regular documentation updates prevent knowledge loss between sessions
