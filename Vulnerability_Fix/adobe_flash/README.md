# Uninstall All Versions of Adobe Flash Using SCCM

## Description

Create and deploy a package in SCCM (or other RMM/GPO etc.) to uninstall all versions of Adobe Flash Player from target machines.

## Details

### Objective

Uninstall all versions of Adobe Flash Player from all target machines.

### Steps to Accomplish

#### Step 1: Create a PowerShell Script to Uninstall Adobe Flash

Develop a PowerShell script that searches for and uninstalls all versions of Adobe Flash Player. The below example should be tested/modified to fit your needs.

[View the PowerShell script](./uninstall_flash.ps1)

#### Step 2: Create a Package in SCCM

- In the SCCM console, navigate to `Software Library` > `Application Management` > `Packages`.
- Right-click `Packages` and select `Create Package`.
- Provide a name and description for the package.
- Set the source folder to the location where the PowerShell script is stored.

#### Step 3: Create a Program

- In the `Programs` tab, create a new program.
- Set the command line to `powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "uninstall_flash.ps1"`.
- Configure other settings as needed (e.g., run with administrative rights).

#### Step 4: Distribute the Package

- Distribute the package to the distribution points.

#### Step 5: Deploy the Package

- Deploy the package to the target collection of machines.

### Justification

Adobe Flash Player is no longer supported and poses security risks. Removing all versions ensures compliance with security policies and reduces potential vulnerabilities.

### Impact

This action will remove Adobe Flash Player from all targeted machines, ensuring they are secure and compliant with current IT policies.

## Additional Notes

Please ensure that the package is tested on a small group of machines before wide deployment to avoid any unintended disruptions.
